<h2>My Thoughts on Herman Hesse's 'Siddhartha'</h2>

</i>Siddartha is a paradox, and leaves me more confused than I was.<i>

Siddhartha is the journey of a man through his life. The start of the
book resembled that of The Buddha's journey and the misleading book
covers and some pretentious reviews on the net made me think that this
was indeed the journey of how Gowtama became The Buddha. However, this
book is about a common man, a man who doesn't heed to the teachings of
The Buddha. He didn't care what the ***words*** were; he gave importance
to the ***experience*** indeed.

According to me, the author was trying to answer a question that I have
been trying to answer myself for the longest time. That is probably why
this book has resonated so deeply with me.

<i>Why is there only **one** Buddha? Why is there only **a single**
'Enlightened One'?</i>

The answer according to the author is that everyone paid attention to
the words of the Buddha, but even he couldn't put his enlightenment into
meaningful words. The experience that the Buddha had during his hour of
enlightenment, cannot be communicated in any known way to others, and
sadly died with the great one himself. Buddha gave us the four noble
truths and eight-fold path, all which are virtuous and practical. Yet,
nobody reached that stage of enlightenment.

From this realization stemmed the true path of enlightenment for our
Siddhartha, first as a householder, then a merchant, and finally to a
ferryman. There are no great quotes, no striking comments on life.

It is a man seeking the innermost part of his Self. That part of his
Self which is truly him, which is not made up by him, which is not
touched by others and even by himself. That part of himself from which
he, *Siddhartha,* blooms. For me this is the true meaning of the word
spirituality--the search for the untouched, ethereal spirit that
defines the term '*I am*'.

So why is the book a paradox?

If the rotten planks in the ship of Theseus are replaced with new planks
will it still be the ship of Theseus? Will the *Siddhartha*, who changes
his thoughts and beliefs, who changes the food he eats--and mind you
that same food makes him up--, who changes his very directions of his
life quite a number of times. Is he still the same *Siddartha*? The
quest to find that entrenched, embedded part of *you* seems to change
*you* in all ways possible. What he finds out, I can't say...because
that is the essence of this book. It is a paradox. The book teaches you
to learn only from experience and not from any teaching. So, how am I
supposed to learn from this book?

And yet, if there is one thing that stood out in the book, it is to love
and spread love irrespective of whatever comes in the way. I can only
put it as vaguely as this, the rest needs to be known only by reading
the book. Siddhartha was life altering to me in so many ways, I think I
finally got some solace to my *seeking* nature, and maybe I will be able
to become a *finding* person. But I know this for sure; henceforth I
will only learn from experiences and their conclusions.
