<h2>My thoughts on Yuval Noah Harari's 'Sapiens'</h2>
<i>History done right. A book of the ages, for the ages.</i>

In the series finale of the popular series Game of Thrones, Tyrion
Lannister took the stage and reasoned out why the Three eyed Raven, Bran
The Broken, must be made king. He said, "Stories are what bind people
together. And who better to be king than Bran, who knows our complete
past." When I heard that line, I thought there couldn't be a dumber
reason for someone to be made king. After reading Sapiens, however, I
stand corrected.

Sapiens started off as a book trying to explain the origins of the
current species of humans, Homo Sapiens. Soon after, the book diverged
as a commentary on the ever-transient culture of humankind, from the
foragers to the modern 21^st^ century beings. A remarkable feature of
this book is the wide audience it caters to. Historians, psychologists,
social scientists, nutritionists, athletes, minimalists and many more
sects of society will be able to gain some insight of how their
professions evolved from the grass roots.

Captivating, stimulating and unputdownable, Sapiens held me hooked for
over five days. It was an intense read, which had me deeply
introspecting the various ideologies, habits and instincts I had
innately inscribed in me or had imbibed because of my culture and
environment. The book covered the various important revolutions that
humankind went through to come to today's level of comfort and
technological prowess.

Probably the most thought-provoking part of the book was the explanation
of 'common myths' that we as humankind have come to think we are born
with. These "common myths" are the stories that bind us together, and
they are the very essence of our society and civilizations. Theism,
capitalism, nationalism, communism and every other ideology we have is a
construct meant to manage humanity. To escape this construct is
impossible, because the very imagination behind these 'common myths' are
the foundation stones of the evolution of Homo Sapiens. We can move from
one myth to another, but we cannot break it. We would then be no
different than any other primate that roams the face of this earth. This
was a great realization for me; it made sense there was no meaning in
life from a biological standpoint except procreation. We have the genes
to make sure our species is successful, by reproduction, but apart from
that, all other meanings in life are self-imposed. The basis of most of
our myths is ascribing this meaning to life.

The book walked through all the millennia that Homo Sapiens lived
through, presenting accepted theories, archaeological findings and
debatable hypotheses that were scary, wondrous and disillusioning. From
our forager ancestors, to our agricultural roots, and our increasing
reliance on economics, the book covers all the important developments. I
especially liked the fact that the author made sure to understand the
psyche of all our ancestors, as that is what history should be about. So
often, history is misconstrued as just dates and figures, which hold
little importance to our lives. But understanding the mindset, emotions
and feelings of historical figures will help us understand how to shape
our future. The mistakes of the past will help define the breakthroughs
of the future. It is this connection that the book brings about, which
really holds the reader to every page. It is a story, a very good one,
of a species which dominated all the other million species with
considerable ease. And it was all possible due to human cooperation. We
tend to think we are individualistic beings, who can accomplish anything
on Earth by devaluing human ties and bonds. This book served me a
reminder of how important cooperation is, to shape the future of
humankind, and to also survive.

The last part of the book dwelled on happiness, and what it meant
through the ages. The author focused quite a bit on the Buddhist
teachings as the religion is based on finding true happiness. I
encourage you to read the book, and dwell on the many stories of our
evolution. The conclusions you draw might be very different from mine,
but those conclusions will tell you more about yourself and what you
'<i>want to want</i>'. Sapiens, is a must read, according to me. It is not
fiction, it is not history, but certainly somewhere in between.
