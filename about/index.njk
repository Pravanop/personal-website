       <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>
        Hi! I’m <strong>Pravan Omprakash</strong> — a scientist by training, but a lifelong tinkerer with words, light, and imagination.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I’m not building computational models of materials, I’m usually building something else: a poem, a photograph, or a stop-motion world made of LEGO bricks.
        Over the years, I’ve written a poetry collection called <em>Words of a Thinkaholic</em>, spent countless nights photographing miniatures under a desk lamp, and taught myself Blender to bring tiny universes to life.
        This space collects all of that — the visual experiments, the half-finished sketches, the essays and reflections that keep me awake at night.
      </p>

      <p>
        This site is my expressive release — I’m not trained in any of these art forms, nor particularly good at them.  
        So please don’t think of this as a portfolio meant to impress.  
        I like stories that blur boundaries: between art and analysis, order and chaos, imagination and truth.
      </p>

      <p>
